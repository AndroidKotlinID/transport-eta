Uses SMS-Token service or the web to request a more precise ETA of a public-transport (Bus, Boat etc.) to a specific station, currently implementing for Lisbon, but the idea is to scale up to any other cities around the world that provide the same kind of service(s). Most of the complex stuff will happen on the backend anywayâ€Šâ€”â€Šyay ðŸ™Œ Cloud Functions for Firebase. Writing a well cared reactive android client codebase should be enough to adapt.

Using the new Android Architecture Components, keeping the local database as the single source of truth
