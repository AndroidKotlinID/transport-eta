# Transport ETA
  
###   An utility app built from the ground-up on my twitch channel: [twitch.tv/joaquimley](http:twitch.tv/joaquimley)
Uses an SMS based service or the web to request a more precise ETA of a publc-transport (Bus, Boat etc.) to a specific station, currently implementing for Lisbon ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹, but the idea is to scale up to any other cities around the world that provide the same kind of service(s).

Don't forget to follow and watch the stream

#### Some of the cool stuff I'll be integrating in this project:
- Multi module Clean architecture
- Rx
- Kotlin
- Android Architecutre Components
- Firebase: Cloud functions, Firestore
- Tests  ðŸ™Œ


### Why ðŸ¤”
Since I always like to work on some pet-projects I decided to document them on a live coding stream, this way I'll force myself into actually finishing and maybe get some feedback from the community. With others is easier to learn ðŸ“–.
